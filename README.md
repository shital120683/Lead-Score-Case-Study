# Lead-Score-Case-Study
## Problem statement:
Identify the set of leads of X Education so that the lead conversion rate should go up and the sales team of the company focus more on communication with the potential leads rather than making calls to every customer. The company needs a model wherein you a lead score is assigned to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
